# Image Processing and YOLOv8 Square Detection

This project consists of two scripts for image processing and square detection using a trained YOLOv8 model. The first script (`model.py`) detects squares in an image and extracts them using the YOLOv8 model. The second script (`image.py`) processes an image to extract a region of interest (ROI) centered on the image.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
